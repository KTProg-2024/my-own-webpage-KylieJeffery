     <h1>Kylie's Birthday is March 17, 2006.</h1>
     <h2>What Kylie does for her birthday is hang out with one or two friends and famliy and have ice cream cake and chinese food. She does not understand why people celebrate birthdays when it is just some girl having birth but she still hangs out with friends and famliy because they don't let her not celebrate. People mostly have birthday partys but she does not because she does not celebrate and because she knows only two or three people would come. so pretty much all they do is hang out.</h2>
